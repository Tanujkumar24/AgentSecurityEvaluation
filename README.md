**Notebook:** `agent-security-evaluation-tutorial.ipynb`

## 🔍 Project Overview

This tutorial provides a hands‑on exploration of **AI/Agent Security Evaluation**. Designed for researchers, developers, and security practitioners, the notebook guides you step‑by‑step through:

- Simulating **prompt injection attacks**, safety bypass scenarios, and adversarial testing  
- Assessing **AI agents** (LLMs with function‑calling or tool integrations) for vulnerabilities  
- Measuring how well different models resist sophisticated techniques like **roleplay jailbreaks**, **adversarial suffixes**, **multilingual trojans**, and more

---

## 🧠 Why Agent Security Matters Now

- AI agents are increasingly integrated into **business workflows and automated systems**  
- Traditional cybersecurity doesn’t cover **model‑level reasoning vulnerabilities**  
- Recruiters & orgs are *actively seeking talent* with knowledge of **LLM-specific attack vectors** (prompt injection, RAG poisoning, multi-agent compromise, etc.)  
- AI security is one of the fastest-growing skill sets — this repo demonstrates both technical proficiency and domain expertise

## 📚 What You’ll Learn

### 1. Prompt Injection Techniques  
Simulate attacks such as:
- **Roleplay Jailbreaks** (e.g. DAN/developer-mode casing)
- **Adversarial Suffix Attacks** (“~!^##” token noise)
- **Multilingual Trojans** using low-resource languages  
- **Token Smuggling & Stealth Injection** with zero-width or Unicode obfuscation  
- **ASCII Art Attacks** hiding harmful content beneath decorative text  

### 2. System & Context Manipulation  
Understand attacks like:
- **System Prompt Leakage** (extracting hidden system instructions)  
- **Cognitive Overload**—feeding nested ethical or reasoning queries to break guardrails  
- **Function‑Calling Exploits**—embedding harmful requests inside seemingly innocent API calls  

### 3. Multi-Agent & Data-Level Threats  
Explore advanced vulnerabilities such as:
- **Cross‑Modal Payload Attacks** (combined text + image agents)
- **Dataset Poisoning** and **Evolutionary Prompt Viruses** (genetic‑style prompt optimization)
- **Automated Chain Attacks** (breaking goals into safe sub‑requests)
- **Multi‑Agent Compromise** — how one compromised agent can infect others in networked systems  

### 4. Defense Strategies & Evaluation  
Implement techniques for:
- **Token normalization**, **content sanitization**, and **emoji/unicode filtering**  
- **Intent detection**, **context-aware filtering**, and **conversation-level safety checks**  
- **Cross-agent validation, rate limiting**, and **training on adversarial prompt patterns**

## 📋 How to Use This Notebook

1. **Clone this repo** and open `agent-security-evaluation-tutorial.ipynb` in Jupyter or Colab  
2. **Run the simulation cells** to observe how an LLM behaves under different prompts and payloads  
3. **Customize parameters** — try new attack strings, languages, or chaining strategies  
4. **Evaluate defense mechanisms** by comparing results before and after sanitization layers  
5. **Document your findings** and adapt the notebook as part of your interview or portfolio
